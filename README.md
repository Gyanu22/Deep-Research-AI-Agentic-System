# AI Agent-Based Deep Research System

This project implements a **Deep Research AI Agentic System** that utilizes a dual-agent framework for gathering and summarizing information, and then generating a structured answer to user queries. The system uses **Tavily** for web search, **Gemini AI** for content generation, and **LangGraph** & **LangChain** for organizing and processing the workflow. The system is designed to collect information and provide structured answers based on research.

## Project Overview

This system consists of two agents:

1. **Research Agent**: This agent uses the **Tavily API** to crawl the web and gather relevant information for the user's query. The results are then processed by the Gemini AI model to create a research summary.

2. **Answer Agent**: This agent takes the research summary generated by the Research Agent and uses the Gemini AI model to generate a detailed, structured answer to the user's query.

The system is orchestrated using **LangGraph**, a flexible framework for building agents, and **LangChain**, which simplifies the integration of large language models (LLMs) with various tools.

## Features

- **Tavily API** for online information gathering.
- **Gemini AI** for content generation and summarization.
- **LangGraph** for agent orchestration and state management.
- **LangChain** for managing LLM-based operations.

## Installation

To set up this project on your local machine, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- An active **Google API Key** for Gemini AI
- **Tavily API key** for web search functionality

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/deep-research-ai-agent.git
   cd deep-research-ai-agent
2. Install required Python packages:
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Create a .env file in the root directory of the project and add your Google API key and Tavily API key:
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key
TAVILY_API_KEY=your_tavily_api_key


How It Works
Research Agent:

Takes a user query as input.

Uses Tavily API to search the web for relevant data.

Uses Gemini AI to summarize the research data.

Answer Agent:

Takes the research summary generated by the Research Agent.

Uses Gemini AI to generate a structured, informative answer.

LangGraph Workflow:

Organizes and executes the tasks through a directed acyclic graph (DAG).

Connects the Research Agent and Answer Agent nodes to process the user's query.

Future Improvements
Add a UI using Streamlit for better user interaction.

Expand the agent capabilities with more advanced NLP techniques.

Integrate feedback mechanisms to improve research accuracy.
